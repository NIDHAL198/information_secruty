# Compilation Algorithms Overview  

## Introduction  

This section explores key algorithms and processes fundamental to the field of compilation. Compilation is the process of translating high-level programming languages into machine code or intermediate forms, ensuring efficient execution on various platforms. The algorithms covered here form the building blocks of modern compilers, facilitating tasks like lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and automata transformations.  

## Key Algorithms and Processes  

  

1. **NDFA to DFA Conversion**  
   Extending NFA transformations, this process converts a Non-deterministic Deterministic Finite Automaton (NDFA) into a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA), crucial for simplifying automata-based operations in compilers.  

2. **Epsilon Elimination**  
   This technique removes epsilon (Îµ) transitions from an NFA or NDFA, resulting in an equivalent automaton without empty transitions. This is essential for simplifying automata and preparing them for conversion to DFA.  

3. **Scanner Using Lex**  
   Lex is a lexical analyzer generator used to create scanners for tokenizing input source code. It helps in identifying keywords, operators, and literals efficiently, serving as the first phase of a compiler.  

4. **Parser Using Yacc**  
   Yacc (Yet Another Compiler-Compiler) is a tool for generating parsers. It aids in syntax analysis by converting tokenized input from Lex into parse trees or abstract syntax trees, representing the program structure.
